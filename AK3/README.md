# Process Token Manipulation Attack

## Overview

The Process Token Manipulation Attack involves manipulating the access control token associated with a process, typically to elevate privileges or bypass security restrictions. This README provides an overview of how to simulate this attack using TensorFlow or similar techniques and discusses considerations for defending against such attacks.

## Simulating Process Token Manipulation Attack

### Description

In the context of cybersecurity, process token manipulation is a technique used by attackers to modify the security context (token) of a process. This can involve elevating privileges, bypassing access controls, or impersonating other users.

### Attack Simulation

To simulate the process token manipulation attack:

1. **Load Configuration**
    - Load necessary parameters from the configuration file (`process_token_attack_config.json`).

2. **Manipulate Process Token**
    - Simulate the manipulation of the process token using TensorFlow or similar techniques.
    - Example operations include altering permissions, modifying security identifiers (SIDs), or changing token attributes.

3. **Execute the Attack**
    - Perform the token manipulation on the target process identified by its process ID.
    - Log the activity and any changes made to the process token.

### Example Configuration

Example `process_token_attack_config.json`:
```json
{
    "process_id": 1234
}
