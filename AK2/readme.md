# Adversarial Knowledge Workflow Suite (AKWS)

## Overview

Adversarial Knowledge Workflow Suite (AKWS) is a comprehensive framework designed to provide both red and blue teams with a structured template for simulating cyber-attacks and defending against them using machine learning techniques. This README focuses on the DC Sync attack simulation and its defense using machine learning.

## DC Sync Attack

### Description

The DC Sync attack is a technique used to request password hashes from a domain controller (DC) without the need for elevated privileges. It allows an attacker to impersonate a domain controller and retrieve password data from the Active Directory (AD) database, potentially compromising user credentials and security.

### Attack Flow

1. **Load Configuration**
    - Load necessary parameters from the configuration file (`dcsync_attack_config.json`).

2. **Create DC Sync Payload**
    - Simulate the creation of a DC Sync payload using TensorFlow or similar techniques.
    - This payload will be used to request password hashes from the domain controller.

3. **Execute DC Sync Attack**
    - Send the crafted payload to the domain controller to request password hashes.
    - Receive and process the retrieved password data.

4. **Monitor and Log Activity**
    - Log the activities performed during the attack.
    - Monitor for any defensive responses.

### Example Configuration

Example `dcsync_attack_config.json`:
```json
{
    "domain": "example.com",
    "username": "administrator"
}
